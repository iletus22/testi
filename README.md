# PySide6 Desktop Template

This repository contains a minimal Python project that demonstrates the basic structure for a desktop application using PySide6. The modules are placeholders that can be expanded into a full application.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PySide6
   ```

## Running

Run the example application with:
```bash
python main.py
```

The current implementation does not provide full functionality. It simply sets up the application structure with `GUI`, `Storage`, and `Settings` classes ready for further development.
