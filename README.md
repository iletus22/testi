# Monitor Demo

This project provides a minimal starting point for a PySide6-based desktop monitor. It contains placeholder modules for the graphical interface, persistent settings, and data storage.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.8 or newer is available on your system.
3. Install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install PySide6
```

## Launching the Monitor

Run the main module to start the monitor window:

```bash
python main.py
```

The current implementation offers only the bare application skeleton, but it can be extended with custom logic inside `GUI`, `Settings`, and `Storage`.
